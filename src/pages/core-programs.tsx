                  Megan Roup is a popular fitness instructor with a great
                  video-on-demand subscription business. Even as a top tier
                  digital-first instructor, she was offering students interested
                  in her program a pdf of a calendar with the titles of Vimeo
                  videos on it for them to follow along with. We think this
                  experience can be improved upon.

            Programs are a great way for insturctors to re-use existing content
            and keep students engaged. It was important to make the CMS
            experience of building a program straight-forward so that our users
            could easily take advantage of the feature.

            The instructors we were working with had a variety of differnet
            formats for their programs. Some were based on weeks and some were
            divided into sections that didn&apos;t necessarily follow a 7 day
            cycle. In our first build we allowed for as much flexibility as
            possible, but after some user testing we found that we were giving
            users too much freedom and not clear enough guidance on how to
            structure Programs.

                Letting your body recover is an important part of long term
                fitness programs. One of the more fitness-specific elements of
                Core programs is the ability to mark days in the cycle as Rest
                Days for students to mark off.

            Programs offer students a more holistic and guided fitness
            experience. Many instructors wanted to attach additional resources
            to their program such as nutrition plans. As a fast follow to our
            initial launch, we added the ability for instructors to add both
            links and attachments.

            After interviewing multiple instructors, we learned that most of
            them treat programs as a separate offering from their subscription
            business, either using it to funnel in new students or as an add on
            for subscribers. Our next iteration of programs would iclude the
            ability to have a one-off price.
