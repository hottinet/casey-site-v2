          I looked at a handful of budgeting tools, both wedding related and
          not. Most wedding specific tools did not break down to a payment level
          or include the ability to set reminders. Many of them also started
          with lots of prepopulated items that could be overwhleming to the
          couple.

        <Body>
          Most wedding budgets include an estimate, total and balance for each
          budget item. We wanted to find a way to display these numbers in a way
          that made them easy to compare like the spreadsheets most of our
          couples were currently using. After exploring these three iterations,
          we decided that we would remove the concept of an estimate cost from
          our initial system to reduce complexity.

          Once we narrowed down to two numbers per item, we ran a user test
          where we asked users to compare a version of the budget that showed
          the numbers side by side to a version with a segmented control. We
          found that an overwhelming number of people preferred to see the
          numbers next to each other.

          We also had user testers compare a budget tool where the reminders and

          slight lean towards combining the concepts.

          Not all product designers have the luxury of working with a copy

        <Body mb={20}>
          Because we were making a lot of copy changes toward the end of our
          process, it was sometimes hard for the developers to know what had
          changed. In the future, we hope to use components for any repetetive
