      <Body mb={20}>
        Internally, we had lots of ideas about how the ecosystem of Zola
        products might be organized but it was important for us to leave our own
        biases aside and understand how users would organize them.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        We set up a card sort activity to do with 6 real Zola users who were in
        the midst of wedding planning. We presented users with a
        &quot;pileÃŸ&quot; of cards, each reflecting a different product or page
        in the Zola app and asked them to group the cards however made sense to
        them. After a user had grouped the cards how they saw fit, we would
        often ask them to consolidate down to 4 or 5 groups. Interviews were
        executed via Zoom.

            Every person we interviewed created some sort of Inspiration
            grouping that included Community, Real Weddings and Expert Advice.
            This was also a theme we saw in interviews for other projects.

        When translating the groupings from our card sort into designs that we
        could put in front of users, we had two solutions in mind. One that
        continued to use the home page as navigation but in an even bigegr way
        and a second that used sheets to expand each section in the bottom bar.
