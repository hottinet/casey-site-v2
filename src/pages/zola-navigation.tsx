                Our old navigation had a jump menu with space for 8 products.
                This menu got a lot of action from users but had a limited
                number of spots. Therefore, every time we introduced a new
                feature, we would have to debate which items stayed and which
                went. We also found that no matter what we tested putting below
                the jump menu, no one interacted with it meaningfully.

            Internally, we had lots of ideas about how the ecosystem of Zola

            We set up a card sort activity to do with 6 real Zola users who were
            in the midst of wedding planning. We presented users with a pile of
            cards, each reflecting a different product or page in the Zola app
            and asked them to group the cards however made sense to them. After
            a user had grouped the cards how they saw fit, we would often ask
            them to consolidate down to 4 or 5 groups. Interviews were executed
            via Zoom.

            4 out of 5 of the users preferred the giant jump menu option because
            they liked having a high level view of all of the things they could
            do on Zola. Most couples are not experienced wedding planners and
            seeing everything, helped them think about all the things they might
            need to do for their wedding.

            At the same time that I was working on this project, Zola was

            components and pages.

                I also wanted to put more thought into the tapped states of the
                jump menu links. In our previous menu, the text changed colors

                the user&apos;s finger was covering most of the icon and text. I
                worked on multiple iterations where the change could still be
                seen behind a finger.
