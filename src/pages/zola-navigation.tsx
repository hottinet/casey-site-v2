              <Text as="p" variant="bodySmall">
                Our old navigation had a jump menu with space for 8 products.
                This menu got a lot of action from users but had a limited
                number of spots. Therefore, every time we introduced a new
                feature, we would have to debate which items stayed and which
                went. We also found that no matter what we tested putting below
                the jump menu, no one interacted with it meaningfully.

            Internally, we had lots of ideas about how the ecosystem of Zola
            products might be organized but it was important for us to leave our
            own biases aside and understand how users would organize them.
          </Text>
          <Text as="p" variant="bodySmall">
            We set up a card sort activity to do with 6 real Zola users who were
            in the midst of wedding planning. We presented users with a pile of
            cards, each reflecting a different product or page in the Zola app
            and asked them to group the cards however made sense to them. After
            a user had grouped the cards how they saw fit, we would often ask
            them to consolidate down to 4 or 5 groups. Interviews were executed
            via Zoom.

            When translating the groupings from our card sort into designs that
            we could put in front of users, we had two solutions in mind. One
            that continued to use the home page as navigation but in an even
            bigger way and a second that used sheets to expand each section in
            the bottom bar.

            4 out of 5 of the users preferred the giant jump menu option because
            they liked having a high level view of all of the things they could
            do on Zola. Most couples are not experienced wedding planners and
            seeing everything, helped them think about all the things they might
            need to do for their wedding.

            Refining designs and applying new branding

            At the same time that I was working on this project, Zola was
            getting ready to roll out new branding. We decided that this project
            would be the first that we would execute in the new style. In
            parallel, we worked on updating the branding across all of our
            components and pages.

            For our final iteration of the nav links themselves, we decided to

            the copy team to create titles for each section and link.
