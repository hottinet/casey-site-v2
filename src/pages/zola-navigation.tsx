            <Body>
              Our old navigation had a jump menu with space for 8 products. This
              menu got a lot of action from users but had a limited number of
              spots. Therefore, every time we introduced a new product, we would
              have to debate which items stayed and which went. We also found
              that no matter what we tested putting below the jump menu, no one
              interacted with it meaningfully.

          Internally, we had lots of ideas about how the ecosystem of Zola
          products might be organized but it was important for us to leave our
          own biases aside and understand how users would organize them.
        </Body>
        <Body>
          We set up a card sort activity to do with 6 real Zola users who were
          in the midst of wedding planning. We presented users with a
          &quot;pile&quot; of cards, each reflecting a different product or page
          in the Zola app and asked them to group the cards however made sense
          to them. After a user had grouped the cards how they saw fit, we would
          often ask them to consolidate down to 4 or 5 groups. Interviews were
          executed via Zoom.

          From our interviews, we identified 4 main groups to start with. We

          When translating the groupings from our card sort into designs that we
          could put in front of users, we had two solutions in mind. One that
          continued to use the home page as navigation but in an even bigger way
          and a second that used sheets to expand each section in the bottom
          bar.

          4 out of 5 of the users preferred the giant jump menu option because
          they liked having a high level view of all of the things they could do
          on Zola. Most couples are not experienced wedding planners and seeing
          everything, helped them think about all the things they might need to
          do for their wedding.

          At the same time that I was working on this project, Zola was getting
          ready to roll out new branding. We decided that this project would be
          the first that we would execute in the new style. In parallel, we
          worked on updating the branding across all of our components and
          pages.

          For our final iteration of the nav links themselves, we decided to use

              I also wanted to put more thought into the tapped states of the
              jump menu links. In our previous menu, the text changed colors
              when tapped. However, the change was not very noticeable when the
              user&apos;s finger was covering most of the icon and text. I
              worked on multiple iterations where the change could still be seen
              behind a finger.

              After we felt good about the nav links and bottom bar, we turned
              our attention to the rest of the home page. The previous page
              included a lot of marketing, education and other modules that got
              little to no interaction.

              In the old version of the home page, we allowed users to upload a
              photo, but it was not very clear what the photo was connected to.
              For our new home page, we wanted to highlight our wedding
              countdown widget in that space. This would encourage couples to
              add a wedding date, get them familiar with the widget and
              personalize the home page.

          We tried a few other additions to the page inspired by our web team
          including allowing users to choose a theme color for the page and
          giving them easy access to their shareable links. Ultimately, we
          wanted to get more navigation above the fold so did not include either
          of those.
