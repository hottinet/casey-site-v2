          <Body>
            Our old navigation had a jump menu with 8 spots for products. This
            menu got a lot of action from users but had a limited number of
            spots. Therefore, every time we introduced a new product, we would
            have to have an debate about which items stayed and which left. We
            also found that no matter what we tested putting below the jump
            menu, we could not get anyone to scroll or interact.

      <Body mb={20}>
        Internally, we had lots of ideas about how the ecosystem of Zola
        products might be organized but it was important for us to leave our own
        biases aside and understand how users would organize them.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        We set up a card sort activity to do with 6 real Zola users who were in
        the midst of wedding planning. We presented users with a
        &quot;pile&quot; of cards, each reflecting a different product or page
        in the Zola app and asked them to group the cards however made sense to
        them. After a user had grouped the cards how they saw fit, we would
        often ask them to consolidate down to 4 or 5 groups. Interviews were
        executed via Zoom.

        From our interviews, we identified 4 main groups to start with. We
        planned to put this new grouping in a prototype and guage reactions in
        another round of testing.

        When translating the groupings from our card sort into designs that we
        could put in front of users, we had two solutions in mind. One that
        continued to use the home page as navigation but in an even bigger way
        and a second that used sheets to expand each section in the bottom bar.

        4 out of 5 of the users prefered the giant jump menu option because they
        liked having a high level view of all of the things they could do on
        Zola. Most couples are not experienced wedding planners and seeing
        everything, helped them think about all the things they might need to do
        for their wedding.

      <Body mb={40}>
        At the same time that the mobile team was working on this project, Zola
        was refining some new branding. We decided that this project would be
        the first that we would execute in the new styling. In parallel, we
        worked on restyling all of our components across the app.

        {' '}
        For our final iteration of the nav links themselves, we decided to use
        our new brand colors to separate the sections. We worked with the copy
        team to create titles for each section and link. We explored lots of
        options for tapped states of these links.

      <Heading bold>Designing into the rest of the page</Heading>
      <Body mb={20}>
        After we felt good about the nav links and bottom bar, we turned our
        attention to the rest of the home page. The previous page included a lot
        of marketing, education and other modules that got little to no
        interaction.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        In the old version of the home page, we allowed users to upload a photo,
        but it was not very clear what the photo was connected to. For our new
        home page, we wanted to highlight our wedding countdown widget in that
        space. This would encourage couples to add a wedding date, get them
        familiar with the widget and personalize the home page.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        We tried a few other additions to the page inspired by our web team
        including allowing users to choose a theme color for the page and giving
        them easy access to their shareable links. Ultimately, we wanted to get
        more navigation above the fold so did not include either of those.
